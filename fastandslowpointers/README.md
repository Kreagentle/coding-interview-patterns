# Linked List Cycle

Check whether or not a linked list contains a cycle. If a cycle exists, return TRUE. Otherwise, return FALSE. The cycle means that at least one node can be reached again by traversing the next pointer.

# Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a linked list, your task is to check whether the linked list is a palindrome or not. Return TRUE if the linked list is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.

# Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

In a linked list of even length `n`, the node at position `i` (using 0-based indexing) is considered the **twin** of the node at position `(n - 1 - i)`, for all `0 ≤ i < n / 2`.

## Example

If `n = 4`:
- Node `0` and node `3` are twins.
- Node `1` and node `2` are twins.

These are the only twin pairs in a linked list of size 4.
The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node’s value and its twin’s value.
Given the head of a linked list with an even number of nodes, return the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list.
