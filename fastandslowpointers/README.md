# Linked List Cycle

Check whether or not a linked list contains a cycle. If a cycle exists, return TRUE. Otherwise, return FALSE. The cycle means that at least one node can be reached again by traversing the next pointer.

# Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a linked list, your task is to check whether the linked list is a palindrome or not. Return TRUE if the linked list is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.
