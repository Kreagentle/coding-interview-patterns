### Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the treeâ€™s diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

### Invert binary tree

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Convert sorted array to a binary search tree

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
