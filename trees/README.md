### Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the treeâ€™s diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

### Invert binary tree

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Convert sorted array to a binary search tree

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

### Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

### Vertical Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).
If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.

### Binary tree max path sum

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
